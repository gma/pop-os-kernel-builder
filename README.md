Pop!_OS Kernel Builder
======================

This script simplifies the process of **patching the kernel that comes with Pop!_OS**.

Compiling kernel packages requires a very large number of dependencies to be installed. I don't generally want all those packages on my machine, so I prefer to install the dependencies and build the kernel in a [chroot].

To break that down a bit, this script will:

- Use debootstrap to **create an Ubuntu chroot**.
- Copy your local APT `sources.list` files into the chroot (we want to download the kernel from the Pop!_OS package repository â€” this is why you should run this script on a machine running Pop!_OS).
- **Install the build dependencies** into the chroot.
- **Download the source** for the latest available kernel.
- **Apply your `.patch` files** that you've put in the `./patches` folder.
- **Build the kernel** for you.

Installation
------------

    $ git clone https://github.com/gma/pop-os-kernel-builder.git
    $ sudo apt install debootstrap

Usage Synopsis
--------------

    $ sudo ./build-kernel <label>

The `label` argument is required, and will be appended to the version number of the resulting Debian packages. As [explained on the Ubuntu wiki], we need to modify the package version so that we can tell that we're running our modified kernel.

Example
-------

    $ cd pop-os-kernel-builder
    $ cp /path/to/my-kernel.patch ./patches
    $ sudo ./build-kernel mylabel

Note that `build-kernel` will attempt to apply your patch from within the Linux kernel source's folder, using the command `patch -p1 < filename.patch`. The `-p1` will discard the first component of the directory names of the files referenced in the patch. If you find your patch doesn't apply, this might be why. You could edit the script to use `-p0`, but if that doesn't work it may be that your patch won't apply to the current kernel source without a bit of manual work.

Why?
----

These days there isn't much call for those of us who run Linux on the desktop to patch the kernel in a distribution like Pop!_OS.

In my case, I need to apply a [few tweaks] in order to support a hardware modification to my ThinkPad X230 that converts it to support a 1920x1080 screen.
